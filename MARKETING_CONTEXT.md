## What RideViz Is

**RideViz** (rideviz.online) turns GPS activity files (GPX/FIT) into animated route visualizations — shareable art you can drop straight into Reels, TikTok, or Shorts.

**One-line pitch:**
> Animated route art from any GPS file — free to try, $9.99 one-time for Pro.

**How it works:**
1. Drop a GPX/FIT file (or connect Strava for Pro users)
2. Style the route — gradient, color-by metric, stat overlays, background
3. Export: free static PNG or Pro animated MP4 that draws itself frame-by-frame

No account needed. No subscription. Privacy-first (files deleted after processing).

## Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Road cyclists, gravel riders, mountain bikers, runners, triathletes
- Strava users who share activities on social media
- Content creators posting ride content to Instagram, TikTok, YouTube Shorts

**Secondary:**
- Garmin/Wahoo/Apple Watch users who export GPX files
- Athletes logging big events (gran fondos, ultras, races)
- Cycling clubs and communities

**Psychographics:**
- Proud of their rides, want to share them in a way that looks great
- Already post Strava screenshots but want something more visual
- Value privacy — don't want to give away GPS data to sketchy apps
- Appreciate one-time purchases over endless subscriptions

## Angle Ideas for Outreach & Content

1. **"Strava screenshots are dead"** — push the animated MP4 as the upgrade
2. **"Your ride deserves better than a Strava screenshot"** — pain-point hook
3. **"Free tool I use to make my rides look like this"** — show before/after
4. **"No account, no sub, just drop your GPX"** — privacy + simplicity angle
5. **Creator angle** — target cycling content creators who want B-roll / visual content
6. **Event angle** — target people who just finished a race/gran fondo and want to share it
7. **Privacy angle** — "Unlike X, we delete your GPS data immediately" — targets privacy-conscious cyclists
8. **Indie/solo founder angle** — r/SideProject, r/Entrepreneur, Indie Hackers, HN Show
